# Grople-Production-Quantity-Prediction
The dataset contains monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural product (letâ€™s call it Grople syrup, note - 
no relation to actual Maple Syrup) in 10 different provinces of a country between January 2015 to December 2020. 
This Grople syrup comes from a fruit. It takes a few months for the fruits to grow on the trees which bear them. 
It also takes a few days to extract the syrup from the fruits after they have been harvested.

## Overview
This is a Jupyter notebook that predicts the production quantity of Grople Syrup based on historical sales data.

## Description
The notebook uses machine learning techniques to build a model that predicts the production quantity of Grople Syrup based on historical sales data. The data includes information on sales volume, price, marketing spend, and other factors that may impact production quantity. The notebook includes visualizations of the data, model training and testing, and a prediction of future production quantities.

## Installation
To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. You can download Jupyter Notebook from the official website: https://jupyter.org/install.html

Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can download the notebook file from this GitHub repository and open it in Jupyter Notebook.

You will also need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip or conda.

## Usage
To use the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order. The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations for each step of the process.

You can also modify the notebook to use your own data or adjust the model parameters to improve the prediction accuracy.
